Version 1.0
===========

Final release of version 1.0. Fixed a major bug which caused RNAz to
crash on 64 bit machines. Fixed a series of smaller bugs in RNAz and
the helper scripts. Thanks to all people who reported bugs.


Version 1.0pre
==============

- RNAz reads MAF alignments in addition to CLUSTAL W format.

- RNAz reads and processes alignments from the input until an "end of file"
  signal is reached. In other words, you can feed as many alignments to RNAz
  as you want. This speeds up analysis since initialization has only be done
  once.

- A set of Perl programs is provided which automatize the
  pre-processing of alignments and thus make large scale screens
  easier.

- A manual/tutorial is available covering all aspects of using
  RNAz and interpreting the results.

- No environment variable is needed any longer making installation
  easier.

- A Windows installer is available.

- As an experimental feature, an additional SVM was added to guess the
  correct strand of a hit (thanks to Kristin Missal).

- Bugs have been fixed, most notably the strange problem with mangled
  output that occured on some systems. Also the uppercase/lowercase problem
  has been fixed.

- The output has been modified. The classification is now named "RNA" and
  "OTHER" (instead of "no RNA"). The "Combinations/Pair" value was added.
  The output can optionally be displayed with gaps, allowing to recover the
  complete input alignment from the RNAz output.
